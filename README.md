This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running Locally

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `node ./bin/www`

Script that heroku uses to run the app. After building the app for production, run this command to see
how the app will look in production.

## Pushing to Production

Before pushing to heroku, run `npm run build` to remake the build file and retest the changes with `node ./bin/www`. After confirming everything looks good, run: 

`git add.`
`git commit -m <commit message>`
`git push heroku master`

to push to production. The app can be accessed at [jandy.app](https://jandy.app).
